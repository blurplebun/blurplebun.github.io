                    <li>To limit the number of commissions, my commissions are only open to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/artifyber/tiers" target="_blank">Ko-Fi members</a>. You'll need to be a member of any tier before commissioning me.</li><br>
                    <li>Please read the Terms of Service listed below. By commissioning me you acknowledge that you agree to my Terms of Service.</li><br>

                    <li>There is no limitation on character request. But keep in mind that I'm a primarily furry artist and i am more comfortable drawing species i'm interested in (cats, rabbits, dogs and foxes).</li><br>
                    <li>Please provide details and references beforehand as i may sometime not provide sketches or WIPs during the process. You can provide minor revision to the final product later.</li><br>
