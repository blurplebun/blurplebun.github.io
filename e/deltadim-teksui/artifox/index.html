        <hr>Arti Fox is an arctic fox with blue accent colors on parts of his body, such as arms, pawfeet and the base of his tail. His inner ears and eyes are also colored in blue and he has top surgery scars.<br>
                <br>
                Arti likes to play drums and often expresses his pride as a transgender male. Although his selfish and sometime overconfident attitude made him look like a jerk to some people, he still care about the people he loved, such as his family and especially his sister Anna Fox.<br>
                <br>
                Arti was born in Chromasia and moved to Teksui after his gender-affirming surgery. He's currently living in an apartment and work part-time as a fast food employee.<br>
