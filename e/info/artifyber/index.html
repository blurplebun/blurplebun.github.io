                    <h2>Hello!</h2> I'm Artifyber, a furry artist who likes to draw and make music.
                    <hr>
                    I taught myself how to draw since 2021 and produce music for even longer since 2019. Only in the late 2021 did I start to appear online.<br>
                    <br>I started my first daily art challenge on January 1st, 2023. It wasn't called Daily Art+ back then. No significant worldbuilding or lore, just a challenge to develop a consistent art style. I succeeded and I kept going. At halfway through the year I rebranded to Artifyber and started developing a little bit of lore and worldbuilding. I also released my first album "Floriverse" around that time.<br>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    A year passed, and I'm now continuing my art hobby with the Daily Art+ series starting 2024. Drawing is the main activity I spent online the most. I mainly draw my own furry characters, but I also take art commissions from time to time. I quite enjoy drawing my own characters as I find it rather relaxing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Music production is also my hobby. Some say i have a diverse taste in music with the amount of genres i've produced. Honestly, i don't even know what kind of genre i'm making half of the time. I just throw 'n' slice samples and draw melodies and if it sounds good, then it's good. Even if it sounds unusual to a majority.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the future I want to be a game developer and create something out of the worlds and characters i've made. It's a dream of mine to create an actual game and I still have a long way to go.<br>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    All done. Thank you for enjoying what I make :3<br>
